# OID4VC Manager
The OID4VC-Manager library serves as a versatile toolkit for implementing the OpenID for Verifiable Credentials (OpenID4VC) specifications family. Developed by the OpenID Digital Credentials Protocols Working Group, this library empowers developers to work with cutting-edge standards designed to enhance identity verification, privacy, and control for end-users.

The OpenID Digital Credentials Protocols Working Group is dedicated to creating OpenID specifications that enable a
robust model where issuers provide digital credentials to holders. These digital credentials contain cryptographically
signed statements about the holder, offering verifiers the ability to verify their authenticity. The overarching goals
include strengthening user control and privacy over identity information, optimizing identity verification for
efficiency and security, and establishing a universal framework for identification, authentication, and authorization in
the digital, as well as in the real world.

In this library, you'll find Rust implementations for several critical DCP specifications, including:
* [OpenID for Verifiable Credential
  Issuance](https://openid.bitbucket.io/connect/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html) (OpenID4VCI)
* [OpenID for Verifiable Presentations](https://openid.bitbucket.io/connect/openid-connect-self-issued-v2-1_0.html) (OpenID4VP)
* [Self-Issued OpenID Provider v2](https://openid.bitbucket.io/connect/openid-connect-self-issued-v2-1_0.html) (SIOPv2)
